# Honey-Auditor: Automated Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) 🛡️


## 📌 Overview
**Honey-Auditor** is a custom-built Active Defense system designed to detect, log, and block unauthorized SSH brute-force attempts in real-time. 

Unlike passive honeypots that only record attacks, Honey-Auditor acts as an **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** by interacting directly with the Linux Kernel Firewall (`iptables`) to neutralize threats immediately upon detection.

## 🚀 Features
* **Active Deception:** Simulates a vulnerable SSH service (Port 2222) with a fake server banner to lure attackers.
* **Real-Time Blocking:** Automates `iptables` to drop traffic from attacker IPs instantly.
* **Idempotent Logic:** Checks existing firewall rules before adding new ones, preventing rule duplication and performance degradation.
* **GRC Compliance:** Automatically generates professional PDF Incident Response Reports for audit trails.

## 🛠️ Architecture
1.  **Listener:** Python socket server binds to `0.0.0.0:2222`.
2.  **Detector:** Logs connection attempts and extracts Source IP.
3.  **Defender:** Executes `iptables` commands via `subprocess` to ban the IP.
4.  **Reporter:** `fpdf` library parses logs and outputs a forensic PDF.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
* Linux Environment (Kali Linux recommended)
* Python 3.x
* Root/Sudo privileges (required for `iptables`)

### Dependencies
Install the required Python library for PDF generation:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-fpdf
# OR
pip install fpdf

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Python-Honeypot-IPS.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Python-Honeypot-IPS.git)
cd Python-Honeypot-IPS
```

### 2. Run the System (Requires Sudo)
```bash
sudo python3 honey_auditor_v3.py
```
*The system is now listening on Port 2222.*

### 3. Simulate an Attack
(From another terminal or machine)
```bash
# Using Netcat or Browser
nc <YOUR_IP> 2222
```

### 4. Generate Report
To stop the tool (Ctrl+C) and generate the PDF report:
```bash
python3 generate_report.py
```
